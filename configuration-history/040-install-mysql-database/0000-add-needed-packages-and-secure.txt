apt-get update; apt-get install mariadb-server mariadb-client

## Secure it, run:
# mysql_secure_installation

## Restart
# /etc/init.d/mysql restart

# NOTE: May have issues, once securing installation:
# /etc/init.d/mysql start/stop/status may stop working
# also it may not be able to upgrade, and/or err messages in daemon.log
# this is due to obviously securing installation making accounts in /etc/mysql/debian.cnf invalid (no permissions anymore); so scripts misbehave
# either way, that is fixed by editing /etc/init.d/debian.cnf with proper permissions account (root); and/or adding a new full-permission user to mariadb 
# installation (aka debian-sys-maint).
