#TYPE: SYSTEM
#END CONFIG INFO

#
# This is a MySQL example config file for systems with 4GB of memory
# running mostly MySQL using InnoDB only tables and performing complex
# queries with few connections.
# 
# MySQL programs look for option files in a set of
# locations which depend on the deployment platform.
# You can copy this option file to one of those
# locations. For information about these locations, see:
# http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/option-files.html
#
# In this file, you can use all long options that a program supports.
# If you want to know which options a program supports, run the program
# with the "--help" option.
#
# More detailed information about the individual options can also be
# found in the manual.

# *** Application-specific options follow here ***

# *** INNODB Specific options ***

# Additional memory pool that is used by InnoDB to store metadata
# information.  If InnoDB requires more memory for this purpose it will
# start to allocate it from the OS.  As this is fast enough on most
# recent operating systems, you normally do not need to change this
# value. SHOW INNODB STATUS will display the current amount used.
innodb_additional_mem_pool_size = 16M

# InnoDB, unlike MyISAM, uses a buffer pool to cache both indexes and
# row data. The bigger you set this the less disk I/O is needed to
# access data in tables. On a dedicated database server you may set this
# parameter up to 80% of the machine physical memory size. Do not set it
# too large, though, because competition of the physical memory may
# cause paging in the operating system.  Note that on 32bit systems you
# might be limited to 2-3.5G of user level memory per process, so do not
# set it too high.
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 2G

# InnoDB stores data in one or more data files forming the tablespace.
# If you have a single logical drive for your data, a single
# autoextending file would be good enough. In other cases, a single file
# per device is often a good choice. You can configure InnoDB to use raw
# disk partitions as well - please refer to the manual for more info
# about this.
# innodb_data_file_path = ibdata1:10M:autoextend

# Set this option if you would like the InnoDB tablespace files to be
# stored in another location. By default this is the MySQL datadir.

# Number of IO threads to use for async IO operations. This value is
# hardcoded to 8 on Unix, but on Windows disk I/O may benefit from a
# larger number.

# If you run into InnoDB tablespace corruption, setting this to a nonzero
# value will likely help you to dump your tables. Start from value 1 and
# increase it until you're able to dump the table successfully.
#innodb_force_recovery=1

# Number of threads allowed inside the InnoDB kernel. The optimal value
# depends highly on the application, hardware as well as the OS
# scheduler properties. A too high value may lead to thread thrashing.
# A recommended value is 2 times the number of CPUs plus the number of disks.
innodb_thread_concurrency = 16

# If set to 1, InnoDB will flush (fsync) the transaction logs to the
# disk at each commit, which offers full ACID behavior. If you are
# willing to compromise this safety, and you are running small
# transactions, you may set this to 0 or 2 to reduce disk I/O to the
# logs. Value 0 means that the log is only written to the log file and
# the log file flushed to disk approximately once per second. Value 2
# means the log is written to the log file at each commit, but the log
# file is only flushed to disk approximately once per second.
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 1

# Speed up InnoDB shutdown. This will disable InnoDB to do a full purge
# and insert buffer merge on shutdown. It may increase shutdown time a
# lot, but InnoDB will have to do it on the next startup instead.
#innodb_fast_shutdown

# The size of the buffer InnoDB uses for buffering log data. As soon as
# it is full, InnoDB will have to flush it to disk. As it is flushed
# once per second anyway, it does not make sense to have it very large
# (even with long transactions). 
innodb_log_buffer_size = 8M

# Size of each log file in a log group. You should set the combined size
# of log files to about 25%-100% of your buffer pool size to avoid
# unneeded buffer pool flush activity on log file overwrite. However,
# note that a larger logfile size will increase the time needed for the
# recovery process.

# Total number of files in the log group. A value of 2-3 is usually good
# enough.

# Location of the InnoDB log files. Default is the MySQL datadir. You
# may wish to point it to a dedicated hard drive or a RAID1 volume for
# improved performance
#innodb_log_group_home_dir

# Maximum allowed percentage of dirty pages in the InnoDB buffer pool.
# If it is reached, InnoDB will start flushing them out agressively to
# not run out of clean pages at all. This is a soft limit, not
# guaranteed to be held.

# The flush method InnoDB will use for Log. The tablespace always uses
# doublewrite flush logic. The default value is "fdatasync", another
# option is "O_DSYNC".
#innodb_flush_method=O_DSYNC

# How long an InnoDB transaction should wait for a lock to be granted
# before being rolled back. InnoDB automatically detects transaction
# deadlocks in its own lock table and rolls back the transaction. If you
# use the LOCK TABLES command, or other transaction-safe storage engines
# than InnoDB in the same transaction, then a deadlock may arise which
# InnoDB cannot notice. In cases like this the timeout is useful to
# resolve the situation.
