#END CONFIG INFO

#
# This is a MySQL example config file for systems with 4GB of memory
# running mostly MySQL using InnoDB only tables and performing complex
# queries with few connections.
# 
# MySQL programs look for option files in a set of
# locations which depend on the deployment platform.
# You can copy this option file to one of those
# locations. For information about these locations, see:
# http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/option-files.html
#
# In this file, you can use all long options that a program supports.
# If you want to know which options a program supports, run the program
# with the "--help" option.
#
# More detailed information about the individual options can also be
# found in the manual.

#*** MyISAM Specific options


# Size of the Key Buffer, used to cache index blocks for MyISAM tables.
# Do not set it larger than 30% of your available memory, as some memory
# is also required by the OS to cache rows. Even if you're not using
# MyISAM tables, you should still set it to 8-64M as it will also be
# used for internal temporary disk tables.
key_buffer_size = 32M

# MyISAM uses special tree-like cache to make bulk inserts (that is,
# INSERT ... SELECT, INSERT ... VALUES (...), (...), ..., and LOAD DATA
# INFILE) faster. This variable limits the size of the cache tree in
# bytes per thread. Setting it to 0 will disable this optimisation.  Do
# not set it larger than "key_buffer_size" for optimal performance.
# This buffer is allocated when a bulk insert is detected.
bulk_insert_buffer_size = 64M

# This buffer is allocated when MySQL needs to rebuild the index in
# REPAIR, OPTIMIZE, ALTER table statements as well as in LOAD DATA INFILE
# into an empty table. It is allocated per thread so be careful with
# large settings.
myisam_sort_buffer_size = 128M

# The maximum size of the temporary file MySQL is allowed to use while
# recreating the index (during REPAIR, ALTER TABLE or LOAD DATA INFILE.
# If the file-size would be bigger than this, the index will be created
# through the key cache (which is slower).
myisam_max_sort_file_size = 10G

# If a table has more than one index, MyISAM can use more than one
# thread to repair them by sorting in parallel. This makes sense if you
# have multiple CPUs and plenty of memory.
myisam_repair_threads = 1

# Automatically check and repair not properly closed MyISAM tables.
