# effective catchall virtualhost for ALL non-matched hostnames, per all possible IP's and ports!
# must have explicitly all ip:port combinations (i.e. same as enabled Listen directives) to intercept! 
# Note, that *.* instead will not work - b/c is less specific.
# This way catchall gets default host for each ip:port combination to which apache2 is bound to.
# check how it is all parsed/interpreted, using apache2ctl -S
