# Typical install on wi-fi only devices (i.e. laptops with no LAN port,
#	or when the primary iface selected during install is wifi)
#
####
# 
# Typically after install you have wpasupplicant installed
#
# 1) For systemd: ensure interfaces have normal names (see fix systemd shit instruction)
#
# 2) Create file /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf  with the following content:
#
# ----------
# ctrl_interface=DIR=/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
# update_config=1
# p2p_disabled=1
#
# network={
#        ssid="[Network Name]"
#        psk="[Network Password]"
#        priority=100
#}
# -----------
#
# 3) Add the wlan0 to /etc/network/interfaces :
#
# -----------
# allow-hotplug wlan0
# iface wlan0 inet dhcp
#        #wpa-ssid MyNetwork
#        #wpa-psk MyPassword
#        wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
#        # we need next line otherwise the ssh does not work in 5GHz !!!
#        post-up /usr/sbin/iwconfig wlan0 power off
#
# -----------
#
# update-initramfs -u && reboot
#
# 4) Check if there is wifi internet after the reboot!
# 5) If there is inet after reboot, there are usually two processes in ps aux | grep wpa ; one of these is bogus (systemd wpasupplicant service is redundant)
# 6) systemctl disable wpa_supplicant.service
# 7) update-initramfs -u && reboot
# 8) Now you should have wifi inet without the bogus systemd wpa_supplicant process! (as it is based on /etc/network/interfaces config) 
#








# checkup /etc/hosts , add if something is needed
# typical proper config:

#127.0.0.1       localhost
#127.0.1.1       debianlamp.localdomain  debianlamp
#
# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
#::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
#ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
#ff02::2 ip6-allrouters


# If needed, setup /etc/network/interfaces
# Sample /etc/network/interfaces :

###
## This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
## and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).
#
## The loopback network interface
#auto lo
#iface lo inet loopback
#
## The primary network interface
#allow-hotplug eth0
#iface eth0 inet static
#        address 192.168.123.20
#        netmask 255.255.255.0
#        network 192.168.123.0
#        broadcast 192.168.123.255
#        gateway 192.168.123.1
#        # next dns-* options are implemented by the resolvconf package, if installed
#        # dns-nameservers 192.168.167.1
#        # dns-search local
#
###

# for DNS: basically, fix /etc/resolv.conf



# for DNS nameservers, see also here

#/etc/hosts Note 127.0.1.1 should have first fully qualified fqdn name (if any) then the short hostname; important for exim4 as well
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       voip.inss.ca voip
