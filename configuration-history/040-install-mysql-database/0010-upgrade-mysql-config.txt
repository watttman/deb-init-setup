## After restarting mysql, check log to see warnings if it needs upgrade:
# tail -n 100 /var/log/syslog

## In this case:
## 140210 16:48:47 [Warning] Using unique option prefix key_buffer instead of key_buffer_size is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please use the full name instead.
## 140210 16:48:48 [Warning] Using unique option prefix myisam-recover instead of myisam-recover-options is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please use the full name instead.

## Fix in config
# nano -w /etc/mysql/my.cnf


# Ignoring for now this error:
# Feb  1 18:44:04 debianlamp-dev /etc/init.d/mysql[6267]: 150201 18:44:04 mysqld_safe Can't log to error log and syslog at the same time.  Remove all --log-error configuration options for --syslog to take effect.
