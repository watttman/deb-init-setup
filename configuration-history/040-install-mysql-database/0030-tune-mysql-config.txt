## Tune /etc/mysql/mysql.conf depending on the machine and database characteristics

## This is a nontrivial stuff. 
## As a starter:
## Use *.cnf files in this directory - use my.cnf as a starter base with most important settings, 
## and then read/use hints from my-heavy-innodb....cnf detailed files.

## do not forget to set to utf8 /etc/mysql/conf.d/mariadb.cnf
