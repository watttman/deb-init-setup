# checkup /etc/hosts , add if something is needed
# typical proper config:

#127.0.0.1       localhost
#127.0.1.1       debianlamp.localdomain  debianlamp
#
# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
#::1     localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
#ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
#ff02::2 ip6-allrouters


# If needed, setup /etc/network/interfaces
# Sample /etc/network/interfaces :

###
## This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
## and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).
#
## The loopback network interface
#auto lo
#iface lo inet loopback
#
## The primary network interface
#allow-hotplug eth0
#iface eth0 inet static
#        address 192.168.123.20
#        netmask 255.255.255.0
#        network 192.168.123.0
#        broadcast 192.168.123.255
#        gateway 192.168.123.1
#        # next dns-* options are implemented by the resolvconf package, if installed
#        # dns-nameservers 192.168.167.1
#        # dns-search local
#
###

# for DNS: basically, fix /etc/resolv.conf



# for DNS nameservers, see also here

#/etc/hosts Note 127.0.1.1 should have first fully qualified fqdn name (if any) then the short hostname; important for exim4 as well
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       voip.inss.ca voip
