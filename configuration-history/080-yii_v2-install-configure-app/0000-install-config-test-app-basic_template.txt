###
### Install Yii 2 framework, and check accessibility and prerequisites
###
#
# INSTALL FRAMEWORK
#
# RUN AS DEVEL USER
# This will create a dir [projectdir] inside current directory, and will install inside the yii2-app-basic template
# so run as DEVEL USER, in /var/www/... hierarchy; the web/index.php will be in ./[projectdir]/web/index.php
# Will complain for non-empty directory, so first remove the dir if extists, and then it seems the reset_website_dirs.sh script 
# must be run AFTER it website template is created
#
# composer create-project --prefer-dist yiisoft/yii2-app-basic [projectdir]
composer create-project --prefer-dist yiisoft/yii2-app-basic host1-debian-box.local
#
# At this point we have pristine Yii 2 basic project template install (without {log,session,tmp} directories} which our PHP setup needs)


# CHECK PREREQUISITES
#
#
#


###
### Install test/demo web application
###
#
#
#
#
#
#
#
#

###
### Reallocate directories to proper physical places (apache vhost config MUST be able to follow symlinks for all this to work)
