	### ACCESS CONFIGURATION - block all by default! (to be overriden in particular virtualhost config)

        # document root stays on precompiled default /var/www for debian - but we disable all filesystem access below
	# Deny all filesystem access from anyone
	<Directory />
		Options None
		AllowOverride None
		Require all denied
	</Directory>

	# Forbid access to version control directories
	#
	# If you use version control systems in your document root, you should
	# probably deny access to their directories. For example, for subversion:
	#
	<DirectoryMatch "/\.svn">
		Require all denied
	</DirectoryMatch>
	<DirectoryMatch "/\.git">
		Require all denied
	</DirectoryMatch>
